            Modern data infrastructure stores vast quantities of derived data — transformations, aggregations, model outputs,
            format conversions — as opaque bytes, indistinguishable from the raw inputs that produced them. This leads to
            unbounded storage growth, stale data without provenance, manual lifecycle management, and lost reproducibility.
            We present <strong>Deriva</strong>, a distributed file system that addresses data not by path or content hash, but by
            the <em>computation that produces it</em>. In Deriva, every piece of derived data is identified by a cryptographic hash
            of its recipe: the function, its input addresses, and its parameters. This computation-addressed model unifies storage,
            provenance tracking, and intelligent caching into a single layer. The system stores lightweight recipes permanently and
            treats materialized results as an evictable cache — knowing that any evicted result can be deterministically recomputed
            from its recipe. We describe the motivation, architecture, and core abstractions of Deriva, detail its Rust implementation
            across six composable crates, and report on Phase 1: a fully functional single-node system with 244 passing tests covering
            leaf storage, recipe-based derivation, multi-level DAG resolution, cost-aware cache eviction, persistence, streaming,
            and a complete gRPC API with CLI client. Deriva demonstrates that collapsing the traditional three-layer stack of
            orchestrator, lineage tracker, and storage into a single computation-aware storage layer yields a system that can make
            decisions no external tool can — because it has simultaneous visibility into data provenance, cache state, storage pressure,
            and compute cost.

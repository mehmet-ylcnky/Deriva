    <p>
        This paper introduced Deriva, a distributed file system that addresses data by the computation that produces it.
        The core insight is simple: if the storage system knows that <code>output = f(inputs)</code>, it can treat materialized
        results as a cache rather than as primary storage, track provenance as a structural property of the addressing scheme
        rather than as external metadata, cascade invalidation through the dependency graph rather than through manual
        intervention, and make eviction decisions based on recomputation cost rather than on access recency alone.
    </p>

    <p>
        The motivation for computation-addressed storage has been described — the derived data problem that causes storage bloat,
        stale data, manual lifecycle management, and lost reproducibility in data-intensive organizations. Related
        work across build systems, content-addressed storage, lineage trackers, memoization systems, and lazy evaluation
        frameworks has been surveyed, positioning Deriva as the intersection of general-purpose distributed storage and native computation
        understanding. The core abstractions have been defined — computation addresses, recipes, materialization, the dependency DAG,
        and cost-aware eviction — and it has been shown how they interlock to produce emergent capabilities that no single abstraction
        provides alone.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Phase 1 implementation has been presented: a fully functional single-node system written in Rust, organized as six
        composable crates, with a complete gRPC API (six RPCs including server-streaming retrieval), a command-line client,
        and 244 passing tests covering leaf storage, recipe-based derivation, multi-level DAG resolution, diamond dependencies,
        cache behavior, persistence across restarts, large blob streaming, error handling, and concurrent operations. The
        implementation demonstrates that computation-addressed storage is not merely a theoretical concept but a practical
        system that can be built, tested, and used.
    </p>

    <p>
        The tradeoffs have been discussed honestly: the determinism requirement constrains which computations can be addressed, the
        recomputation latency on cache miss makes the system unsuitable for strict-latency workloads, the system complexity
        exceeds that of a traditional blob store, and function versioning requires careful management. For each limitation,
        concrete mitigation strategies have been described — some already implemented, others planned for future phases.
    </p>

    <p>
        The road ahead includes making the single-node system production-grade (Phase 2: persistent DAG, async parallel
        materialization, verification mode, observability), scaling to multiple nodes (Phase 3: gossip-based discovery,
        tiered replication, locality-aware compute routing), and expanding to new use cases (Phase 4: WASM plugins, FUSE
        mount, chunk-level partial reads, mutable references).
    </p>

    <p>
        Deriva's contribution is not any single technique — content addressing, memoization, DAG-based lineage, and cost-aware
        caching are all established ideas. The contribution is <em>unifying</em> them at the storage layer, where their
        combination enables decisions that none of them can make independently. A lineage tracker cannot trigger eviction. An
        orchestrator cannot see what's cached where. A cache cannot assess recomputation cost. A storage system cannot track
        provenance. Deriva can do all of these because, in Deriva, they are not separate systems — they are different facets
        of a single abstraction: the recipe.
    </p>

    <div class="insight-box">
        <strong>The recipe is the load-bearing abstraction.</strong> From a single compact descriptor — function, inputs,
        parameters — Deriva derives the address (hash the recipe), the provenance (read the recipe), the recomputability
        (execute the recipe), the dependencies (walk the recipe's inputs), and the eviction safety (the recipe is never lost).
        Everything else follows.
